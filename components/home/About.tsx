                <strong className=" animate-bounce">👋🏼</strong> Hello! I&apos;m Caleb, a computer science enthusiast with a Bachelor&apos;s Degree in Computer Science and interests in full-stack development, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science.
                <br/><br/>
                📚 My educational journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer science, and I&apos;ve further enriched my knowledge through notable courses such as Database Systems (providing expertise in relational databases), Machine Learning (deepening my understanding of various models and their capabilities), Artificial Intelligence, Interdisciplinary Collaborations (providing professional experience in multidisciplinary teamwork), and Software Engineering.
                <br/><br/>
                💻 In addition to my academic achievements, I&apos;ve embarked on a hands-on journey by completing numerous full-stack projects. This journey has led me to become proficient in languages such as Python, Javascript, and Typescript, as well as frameworks like React.js, Next.js, Express.js, and Node.js. These projects have also solidified my understanding of RESTful API, and deepened my knowledge of Database Design and Development. Furthermore I have also become familiar with Docker and Containers.
